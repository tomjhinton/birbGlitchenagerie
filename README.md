# birbGlitchenagerie

For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was 'Creatures With Glitches'.

I mean first off as the year comes to an end thanx Raph for hosting and everything else and thanx everyone who's let me post my stupid stuff here and in your community. Everyone's so supportive and impressive and it's such a great vibe.

- Ok, had a bit of a rushed one this week.
- Had big plans that got eaten by shrinking time.
- Had medium plans that got eaten by shrinking time.
- Delivered small plan.

Now I don't know how many of you do any 3D modelling but the main thing I've learnt from it is that I don't know what anything looks like from memory. Here are some 'creatures?' that I modelled without a reference image.

- No I don't know what they are either.
- Quick blender models and baked textures.
- Loaded them into three.js
- Tweaked some stuff with shaders.
- Yes I'm aware this is pretty much what I do every week.

Basically reused some vertex shaders from elsewhere that become glitchy when applied to the wrong shapes.

- First one's just some noise, noise counts as glitchy.

- Did not really get around to styling anything.
- I think it kind of fits though?
- My artistic style is 'Miscalculated the amount of time to leave for CSS'
- Oh boy does the layout not work on my phone.
- Yes I could've just used tweakpane.
